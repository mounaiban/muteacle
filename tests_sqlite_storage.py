"""
Muteacle SQLite Repository Test Suite (in storage)

This test suite repeats the tests in the module ``tests_sqlite``,
but with writing to the file system.

Running the test suite leaves files in the source tree with names
similar to ``_db_test_sqlite_2101-12-25_1.0-mk1.sqlite3``.  These
files may be safely deleted without affecting use of the library.

The filenames contain a run date (without time) and the target
library version number. A new file is created for every day one or
more tests are run. Incorrect timekeeping on the system running the
tests will result in inaccurate filenames.
